My favourite place is home at Coimbatore, India. Being there for as long as I can remember and moving
out to Chennai, I missed that place full of comfort and love.

Whenever I go home, my dad always takes me out to someplace new. Going to a new place does not make
me happy but just my parents presence and their unconditional love completes my trip there.
