My name is Jerry Caleb and did my undergraduate in Mechanical Engineering at Karunya University. I worked in Valeo as a Simulation Engineer for 5 years. During my tenure there I did few scripting activities and eventually got to know about data analytics and ML. I started exploring that and did a project in our company in Machine Learning and wanted to learn more in detail and practically and so I opted for this course.
